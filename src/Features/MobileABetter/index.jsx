                      I would love to express my interest in the Full-Stack
                      Developer role that I found on LinkedIn. I did a little
                      research and found that your mission is to connect businesses
                      with skilled Microsoft technology professionals, which is quite an innovative idea. I would love to work with the team of people who are making this mission possible technologically.
